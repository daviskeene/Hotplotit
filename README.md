# Hotplotit
Hotplotit- A HotPlot tool for prioritizing tasks in a list.

There are many ways to prioritize things. In the context of digital products, the goal of a HotPlot™ is to reduce the amount of time it takes to arrive at a prioritized list of things, and increase the confidence that that list is correct. 

The framework itself is likely familiar to you. It’s based on a traditional prioritization matrix (sometimes called a decision matrix or Eisenhower matrix). These types of matrices have been used for decades in business, product, and even personal time management scenarios. But what makes a HotPlot™ a HotPlot™ is the process by which we arrive at a prioritized list.

1. Build a simple list of things you might work on.
2. Get a group together with representatives from any important areas relative the work being done.
3. Rank each item in the list in terms of "awesomeness" and difficulty.

The items are then ranked by their overall awesomeness and easiness. Items that are more awesome and easier are ranked before items that are harder or less awesome.
From this, a list can be made detailing which items a team should prioritize.
